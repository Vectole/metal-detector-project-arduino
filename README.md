## Metal Detector project for STM32 (blue pill board) written in Arduino (C)
This project is code for my 1-week project metal detector.

When the second hardware version of my metal detector is made, all further improvements to the firmware functionality will be made using Rust [in this project](https://github.com/Vectole/metal-detector-project).

More information about the project is in my [reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/bri7i7/diy_pulse_induction_metal_detector_my_1week/)
